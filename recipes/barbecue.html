    <h3>Who does not like some well cooked and fat beef rib? Well, some people don't. But we do, so here is a very simple recipe to prepare a good barbecue for you and your friends.</h3>
    <ul><strong>Here is the list of ingredients:</strong>
        <li>Meat</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Anything else (like spices) if you want to have more work to do.</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><strong>How to prepare:</strong>
        <li>First, you put salt all over the piece of meat you have. Since we're talking about beef ribs, that's what you put salt on.</li>
        <li>After that, you take everything to your grill or whatever you are using to barbecue your beefs.</li>
        <li>Wait long enough, turn the beefs a few times, and you're good to go (meaning the beefs are good to be eaten; you can stay).</li>
    </ol>
