    <h3>It is practical. It is delicious. It allows different combinations and variations. Let see how it's done.</h3>
    <ul><strong>You will need:</strong>
        <li>1,5kg of grounf beef</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Potatoes of your liking</li>
        <li>Tomatoes, specially naked tomatoes (<em>pomodori pelati</em>)</li>
        <li>Spices (consider herbs and pepper) </li>
        <li>Onions</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><strong>How to prepare:</strong>
        <li> <em>Short version:</em> put it all together in a pan, put the pan on the stove, and forget about it.</li>
        <li><em>(Not so) long version:</em> put the ground beef with salt in a pan, and add a little bit of water. No oil needed.</li>
        <li>Slice your potatoes the way you prefer and add them, together with the spices.</li>
        <li>Wait for sometime (maybe 15 minutes) and add sliced onions and tomatoes.</li>
        <li>Keep mixing everything from time to time until the meat and the potatoes are cooked.</li>
        <li>Of course you can make it all with more ingredients and refinement, but that's enough.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro tip</strong>: add parmesan cheese when it's hot.</li>
    </ol>
