    <h3>They are tasty and cheap. Also, they are easily prepared and can guarantee a very good meal.</h3>
    <ul><strong>Be sure to have ready:</strong>
        <li>1,5kg of chicken thighs</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Potatoes of your liking</li>
        <li>Spices (consider herbs, pepper and mustard) </li>
        <li>Onions</li>
    </ul>
    <ol><strong>How to prepare:</strong>
        <li>Make little cuts on the thighs and throw some salt one both sides.</li>
        <li>Add the spices you picked.</li>
        <li>Spread the pieces in a baking dish together, with the skin on the upside, with the potatoes and half-sliced onions.</li>
        <li>Get it all in a very hot oven for over an hour, so the skin get very crispy (you will risk getting a few parts toasted, but it's worth the risk).</li>
        <li>Eat it all happily.</li>
        <li><strong>Pro tip</strong>: let it bake with high temperature but away from the top of the oven, and only after about 50 minutes you get it to the top section of the oven (if that's where your oven is hotter, like mine). After that, wait about 20 or 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
    You can always prepare it in a <a style="font-family: cursive; font-size: larger;";" href="https://www.jocooks.com/recipes/oven-baked-chicken-thighs/">fancier way</a>.
